## Joy Herman

### 5/24

wrote the left and right methods and made sure they didn't go out of the screen

### 5/27

wrote a buggy plunge

### 5/28

tried to fix plunge after both of us made changes, started working on clearing a row

### 5/29

added pieces we forgot about and tried clearing a row with a different method

### 5/30

debug the clearRow and found out the way we first implemented the array was backwards

### 5/31

randomized the pieces and fixed the pieces I added on 5/29

### 6/2

organized the code so it's easier for us to see

### 6/3

tried changing the size of the board and was fixing the problems that came up because of that

### 6/5

continued what we did on 6/3 - made numbers into variables to use in all the code

### 6/6

made it so we can reset the game and made a lose screen

### 6/9

made start and game over screen, changed the rates at which the pieces fall, made the stats for the pieces


## Stanley Huang

### 5/22

Made the files, added method names to the classes, and wrote simple methods for Block

### 5/23

Wrote additional Block methods and started to write fall()

### 5/26

Wrote rotate(), fall() and moveleft()/moveright() works for bigger Pieces, Pieces that reach the bottom stay on screen

### 5/28

Wrote working rotate() and plunge(), Pieces fall like they are in a grid

### 5/29

Fixed minor issue with plunge()

### 5/30

Made a new Game file

### 5/31

Fixed error where blocks are shifted to the right, wrote debugBlocks(), moved willfall() to Tetris

### 6/2

Blocks now stack after they stop falling

### 6/3

plunge(), moveleft(), and moveright() cannot go through blocks

### 6/4

Everything works for the new board size, rotate now doesn't move the piece sideways, added different speeds based on rows cleared

### 6/6

Changed background to black, pieces spawn horizontally oriented, added sprites for blocks, included unable to spawn piece as a loss condition, if you lose nothing can be interacted with

### 6/9

displayed the stats for the pieces, made shortcuts to higher levels (faster speed)
e sure they didn't go out of the screen

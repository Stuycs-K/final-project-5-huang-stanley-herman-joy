## Overview
Weâ€™re going to recreate the original NES tetris in processing. This should include the core features, like being able to rotate pieces and see the next piece, and should have the same visuals as the actual game (background, piece colors, etc). The nice to have features are either features that make it feel like the original tetris or features that more modern variants have introduced.
## Instructions
Just press the run button and it will run

## How to play
the 'a' key moves the piece to the right
the 'd' key moves the piece to the left
the 's' key drops the piece all the way to the bottom
the 'r' key rotates the piece
the enter key starts a new game
